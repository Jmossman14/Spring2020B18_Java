OOP inheritance intro: - easiest way to get rich
    - buIlds a relationship between classes

    super (parent) & sub (child) relationships
    extends = inheriting one feature from one class to another class

    super: (cannot inherit) main class where varibales are stored
    sub: (inherites from super class) the class that calls the supers variables
advantages: improves reusability & easy to maintain
IS A vs. Has A

    IS A: inherited relationships between classes
        super class: class Animanl{}
        sub class: class Dog extends Animal{}
                Dog is an ANIMAL
        sub class: class Cat extends Animal{}
                Cat is an ANIMAL
    HAS A:
        class: class Engine(){}
        class: class Car{
                    Engine ob1 = new Engine;}
                    Car HAS A engine
Multi-level ineheritance:
    Public class A {}
    Public class B extends A{} ---> inherits A variables
    public class C  extends B{}  ----> inherits A & B variables

    What can be inherited?? : Variables & methods

super keyword
