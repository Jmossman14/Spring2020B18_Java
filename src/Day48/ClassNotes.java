    Interface: the blueprint of a class; ONLY specifies the behaviors a class should implement
            - used to achieve abstraction
            - uses the keyword "Implement" in order to be extended by another "class"
            - There is only 1 AccessModifier allowed which is PUBLIC
            - "Extends" keyword can be used from 1 Interface to another  (cannot be used from interface to a class)
            AccessModifier interface interfaceName{
               Whatever the class should implement
                                    }


    Why do we need interface?
        - A class can ONLY extend 1 class BUT it can implement more than 1 interface

    WHat we can have in interface?
        variables:FINAL & STATIC
                    - cannot use Instance because it belongs to the class, class cannot go into interface
        methods: abstract methods, static methods, default methods

    what we cannot have in interface?
           constructor
           instance variables
           instance methods
           instance blocks
           instance block
