2. create a custom class for the carpet class that should contain the following:
				instance variables
						width, length, unitPrice, isPersian (boolean)
				instance methods:
						customOrder(): sets the carpet' width, length, unitprice, & isPersian
						calcCost(): should be able to calculate the total cost of the carpet and return it as double
						toString(): should be able to display all the info of the carpet including the total cost of the carpet as calculated by calcCost()
			total price of carpet= (width*length)*unitprice
			if the carpet is persian  carpet that's came from Turkey, add 200$ to the totalPrice
